## Difference between lab1 and lab10

1. In Lab1, code maintainability, for each of the gumball machine we had to create different methods for number of coins inserted, gumball ejected etc so lot of code had to be written and was difficult to manage.

2. In the Feature IDE with AspactJ we define all the configurations in a seperate config file which tells us what type of model is to be chosen, no of quarters to be inserted and coins that can be inserted to get a Gumball. This way the code is manageable and shorter.
