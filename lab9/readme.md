### Comparison between Java Design Pattern and Functional version

1. Used Map to map a shape name to its constructor as in Java 8 we can refer to constructors just like we refer to methods in previous versions.
2. Used map to instantiate different shapes in the functional version.
3. Used Lambda expression in FactoryPatternDemo of functional version to get object of concrete class.
4. The biggest advantage of using functional version was the reduction in number of lines of code.
